## Movies

An app that lists movies by different sort criteria with the ability
to search movies. You can also view details of a movie.

It's made using Android Architecture Components & Jetpack.

The primary purpose of this app is to **learn** how to build somewhat complex apps.
Practices used here are not necessarily those that I'd use now to build apps.
This is an unfinished app that has lots of bugs, no strict separation of concerns, no tests, etc.
Again, this is **my personal experiment**.
